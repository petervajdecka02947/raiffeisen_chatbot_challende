        <h4 style='text-align:center;'>Architectural Overview</h4>
        <p>RaifBot leverages AWS cloud infrastructure with EC2 instances for scalable and efficient computing. The backend is implemented using FastAPI, a high-performance web framework ideal for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.</p>
        <p>The frontend is designed with Streamlit, allowing for dynamic and interactive web applications powered directly by Python scripts. RaifBot employs a microservices architecture, orchestrated with Docker Compose, to ensure a modular and maintainable codebase.</p>
        <p>The four key microservices are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>API Service:</strong> Manages all backend logic, incorporating the Whole Langchain agent deployed within FastAPI.</li>
            <li><strong>CLI Service:</strong> Provides command-line interactions with the API for streamlined operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Streamlit Frontend:</strong> Facilitates user interactions and communicates with the API, enabling real-time updates without page reloads.</li>
            <li><strong>Nginx:</strong> Serves the entire application securely using HTTPS with CertBot certificates, ensuring robust security and reliability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This architecture supports high concurrency and asynchronicity while ensuring the application is fully scalable, allowing multiple users to operate their own instances of RaifBot simultaneously. Conversations are stored in MongoDB by session ID, and the source dataset is managed within a Pinecone Vector database for optimized data retrieval.</p>
        <p>At the core of our generative AI capabilities, RaifBot uses the GPT-4 model for generating responses and leverages the "text-embedding-3-large" embeddings for the retrieval process. This combination ensures accurate, contextually relevant, and engaging user interactions.</p>
        <p>These technical decisions highlight my ability to design and deploy scalable, secure, and effective AI solutions that address modern business needs and technological challenges.</p>
